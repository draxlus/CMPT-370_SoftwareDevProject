* When you want to do a task from your to-do list, simply press the 'Move' button to move it. If you want to move a card that is not the top card, enter the card number (1 is the top card) and then press move.
* When you move the card, you have the option to start a Pomodoro Timer. The Pomodoro Timer, is a 25 minute timer, that allows you to employ the Pomodoro Technique, a powerful time management method.

* If you chose to use the Pomodoro Timer, you will be alerted after your 25 minutes are up. You can repeat the timer as many times as you want.
* Once you're done with a task you can move it to the 'Done' column, the same way as you did earlier. Just press 'Move' to move the top task, or enter a card number to move a particular card.
